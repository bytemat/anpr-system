# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) System

### A real-time ANPR system powered by Flask and YOLOv8
This project implements a real-time Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system that detects and reads vehicle registration plates in Paraguay. Using YOLOv8 for detection and Flask for the web interface, the system supports both the traditional red plates and the newly introduced Mercosur plates.

### Key Features:
- Real-time license plate recognition for vehicles in Paraguay
- Developed using Flask for a robust web interface
- Utilizes YOLOv8 for accurate and efficient plate detection
- Supports both traditional red plates and the new MERCOSUR blue plates
- Suitable for automatic tolling, security monitoring, and other applications
