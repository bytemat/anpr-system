# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) System

### A real-time ANPR system built with Flask and YOLOv8 for detecting Paraguay license plates.

This project implements a real-time Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system that detects and reads license plates in Paraguay. Using YOLOv8 for detection and Flask for the web interface, the system supports both the traditional red plates and the new blue MERCOSUR plates.

### Key Features:
- Real-time license plate recognition for vehicles in Paraguay
- Developed using Flask for a robust web interface
- Utilizes YOLOv8 for accurate and efficient plate detection
- Supports both traditional red plates and the new MERCOSUR blue plates
- Suitable for automatic tolling, security monitoring, and other applications
